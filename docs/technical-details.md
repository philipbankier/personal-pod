# Technical Overview and Details

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React (built using Lovable)
- **Deployment:** AWS Amplify (or another scalable hosting service)
- **Features:**
  - Minimalist UI for topic input (freeform entry or category selection)
  - User account management to store and access generated podcasts
  - In-app playback of personalized podcasts with history and feedback options

### Orchestration & Workflow (Make.com)
- **Platform:** Make.com, which orchestrates our end-to-end agentic workflow.
  
#### Key Workflow Steps:
1. **Webhook Trigger:**  
   - Captures the user’s topic from the frontend.
  
2. **Dynamic Search Term Generation (LLM Steps):**  
   - **For Twitter:** GPT-4o generates a comma-separated list of search terms based on the user’s topic.
   - **For Reddit:** A separate GPT-4o node generates search terms and suggests relevant subreddits.
   - **For News:** Another GPT-4o node produces search terms for querying news articles.

3. **Data Scraping:**
   - **Twitter Data:**  
     - **Apify Tweet Scraper V2:** Uses the generated Twitter search terms to scrape relevant tweets.
   - **Reddit Data:**  
     - **Apify Reddit Scraper Lite:** Uses the generated Reddit search terms to fetch posts.
   - **News Data:**  
     - **NewsAPI (Top Headlines):** Uses dynamic search terms to fetch U.S. top headlines including descriptions and URLs.

4. **Data Synthesis (LLM Summarization):**  
   - An o3-mini LLM node synthesizes the outputs from the three data sources into a comprehensive, objective report.
   - The summarization prompt is carefully tailored to include:
     - The user’s topic (e.g., “AI and Robots Market Update”) from the webhook.
     - Direct references to data outputs from Twitter, Reddit, and NewsAPI.

5. **Podcast Conversion:**  
   - The synthesized report is sent to a dedicated Flask app hosted on AWS EC2.
   - **Flask App Details:**
     - Runs a Podcastfy-based Python script integrated with ElevenLabs TTS.
     - Dynamically builds podcast details (name, intro) from the user’s topic.
     - Converts the report to an audio file, uploads it to AWS S3, and returns a public URL.

6. **Content Delivery in Web App:**  
   - The final podcast URL is returned to the webapp.
   - Users can play the audio directly and access previous episodes in their account.

## Backend Service: Podcast Conversion Flask App
- **Platform:** AWS EC2 running a Flask application.
- **Functionality:**
  - Receives text reports via HTTP calls from Make.com.
  - Processes the text using the Podcastfy conversion script with dynamic configuration (podcast name and intro based on the topic).
  - Uploads the audio file to AWS S3.
  - Returns a public URL for in-app playback.

## Future Roadmap & Ambitious Vision
- **Data Integration:**  
  - Expand to include conventional sources (financial feeds, academic journals) and unconventional ones (influencer content, live event streams, curated newsletters) to create a multi-dimensional view.
- **Meta-Digest Creation:**  
  - Develop a feature that summarizes all personalized podcasts and newsletters into a weekly meta-digest, guiding users on what to consume.
- **Advanced Personalization:**  
  - Implement granular customization, real-time feedback loops, and AI recommendations to continually refine content delivery.
- **Community & Monetization:**  
  - Build a social ecosystem for sharing and remixing podcasts with monetization options (subscriptions, sponsored content, revenue sharing).
- **Global & Multilingual Support:**  
  - Incorporate language localization and regional customization to serve a diverse global audience.
